Definitions,,,,,,
Household Income from Work:,,,,,,
"Refers to the sum of income received by employed members of the household from employment and business. However, it does not include the income of domestic workers. Monthly household income from work includes one-twelfth of the annual bonus. Data on household income from work refer to household income from work before accounting for Government transfers and taxes, unless stated otherwise. As the income data pertain to income from work, the coverage of households is based on resident employed households. Data on household income are based on the sample of households surveyed in the June Comprehensive Labour Force Surveys conducted by the Ministry of Manpower every year, except for 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2020 which are based on the Censuses of Population and the mid-decade General Household Survey. The income estimates are based on income as reported by survey respondents and augmented with administrative data.",,,,,,
Household Income from Work Per Household Member:,,,,,,
"Refers to the household income from work divided by the total number of members in the household. For example, if there is one person in a household of four who is employed, his income is divided by four to derive the income per household Â  member. This takes into account the different sizes of households in each group and enables analysis of changes in household income, adjusted for changes in household size over time.",,,,,,
Type of Dwelling:,,,,,,
"A dwelling refers to a building or part of a building used or intended to be used by one or more persons as living quarters. Each dwelling has its own separate entrance with direct access to a public road or pathway. A dwelling may be a residential building by itself, or a unit in a residential building, or part of a non-residential building such as a shop or factory with space used as living quarters. Dwellings are broadly classified into the three categories: Housing and Development Board (HDB) properties, condominiums and other apartments, and landed properties. For data from 2012, the Singapore Standard Classification of Type of Dwelling (Jan 2012) is used to classify the type of dwelling.",,,,,,
